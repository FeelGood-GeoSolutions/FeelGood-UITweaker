Tap the button added by the plugin to open its settings.
Here, you can adjust the layer text scaling and toggle the custom digitizing cursor.

The button can be disabled in the plugin’s settings. If disabled, the settings remain accessible through the plugin manager.

### Theme Manager

The Theme Manager can be enabled in the plugin settings.

Once enabled, a color-palette icon appears in the bottom-left corner of the settings window. Select it to open the Theme Manager.

In this window, you can adjust the QField theme’s color values to your liking. All colors support transparency.

Use the Button in the top right to reset custom colors back to QField defaults.

Hint: Some colors, mainly gray tones, change based on the base theme selected (dark/light). Try changing it if something doesn't look quiet right.
